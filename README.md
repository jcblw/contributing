# Contributing 

Having contibutions and contributing to other repos is why Github and code sharing is great. Sometimes its not so easy to know where to start CONTRIBUTING.md helps. People already [know this](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines) and its becoming a great convention. This repo is primarly built to help me remeber or have a starting point for my projects CONTRIBUTING.md file.
